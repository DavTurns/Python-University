# Python-University

Welcome to my repository for university assignments in Python.

## Homework 1

This section contains two exercises implemented in separate functions within the same file. The code and assignments are provided in German.

### Exercise a)
Read sequences of positive integers (each sequence ends with 0, and the global sequence ends with -1). Determine the greatest number in each sequence and the greatest number in the global sequence.

### Exercise b)
Find the longest consecutive subsequence of numbers within a specified interval.

## Homework 2

Here, you'll find seven small exercises, each with its assignment detailed at the top of every function.

## Homework 3

In this assignment, I utilize Turtle, a Python library, to draw various objects on the screen and practice the principle of breaking down a program into multiple functions.

## Homework 4

This lab primarily employs Turtle as well but in a more advanced manner. Additionally, I created my own packages with different modules and functions to maintain a cleaner code organization.

### Exercise 1

This exercise consists of two distinct subprograms:
1. Input a text that Turtle displays on the screen.
2. Add or overwrite any letter by drawing a new one.

### Exercise 2

Here, I developed a program that replaces a specified word with another in a file and displays the number of times the word was replaced.

### Exercise 3

This program engages the user in a game of rock, paper, scissors. It operates on a best-of-three basis, and after each round, Turtle illustrates the choices made by the user and the program. The program reads drawing instructions from external files.



## Homework 5
This program is the most complicated of this repository. It integrates the Model-View-Controller design pattern as an application for restaurants with CRUD operations on the customerlist and dishes. 
Furthermore you can place an order and you will get the delivering time and a receipt.
**To run the program please run console.py not app.py**

## Practical exam
It is selfexplaining. Feel free to explore and learn from these assignments!
